# Unity & Azure Pipelines Demo: Lost Crypt

This project is based on [Lost Crypt - 2D Sample Project](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/lost-crypt-2d-sample-project-158673) from Unity Technologies.

[The public project on Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/bananedemo/LostCrypt) demonstrates [CI/CD pipelines](https://dev.azure.com/bananedemo/LostCrypt/_build) for this repository.
You can see actual build logs for Android/iOS platforms.

And here are the public app distribution pages by Visual Studio App Center.  Note that iOS apps won't work on your devices because the issued mobile provisionings are limited to mine.
